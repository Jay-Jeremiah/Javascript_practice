In Html, the Javascript is entered through three ways namely:
    inline
    internal
    external

Inline Javascript is where the Javascript code is written in the tags next to the HTML elements

Internal Javascript is where the code is written in between script tags whereby the script tags are placed
in the head or body sections 

External Javascript is whereby the whole Javascript code is written entirely on a different page from the
HTML file. This file is usually named with an extension of.js
