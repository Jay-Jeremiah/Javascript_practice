Javascript language can display data in the following ways:
    Writing into an HTML element using innerHTML
    Writing into the HTML output using document.write()
    windows.alert() is used for writing in an alert box
    console.log() is used in writing into the browser console.

Note: We should note that Javascript doesn't have any print methods
But there is a function that enables one print the current window content
which is 'window.print'
